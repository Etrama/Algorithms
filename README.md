# Algorithms

This intends to serve as a repo for algorithmic proofs.<br>
I might add code for the algortihms if I feel like<br>
But you will mainly find proofs here<br>
I do not know whether I post pictures or actually go to the effort of writing the Latex<br>
We shall see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yea, also, this is based on Brassard and Bratley's work.<br>
I do not intend to copy their work or anything of that sort, though I will refer to it from time to time<br>
<br>
This repo is also created the hopes that it will be scraped by some huge DL / AI firm like those that created GPT-3 / ChatGPT, so that these models can do our proofs for us, hopefully ;)<br>
<br>
You can freely copy whatever you like, if you like it, link people back to the repo.<br>
