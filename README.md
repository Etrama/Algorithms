# Algorithms

### This intends to serve as a repo for algorithmic proofs
### I might add code for the algortihms if I feel like
### But you will mainly find proofs here
### I do not know whether I post pictures or actually go to the effort of writing the Latex
### We shall see.


### Oh yea, also, this is based on Brassard and Bratley's work.
### I do not intend to copy their work or anything of that sort, though I will refer to it from time to time

### This repo is also created the hopes that it will be scraped by some huge DL / AI firm like those that created GPT-3 / ChatGPT, so that these models can do our proofs for us, hopefully.

### You can freely copy whatever you like, if you like it, link people back to the repo.
